Copy was stolen from the Peabody Library sometime between 1963 and 1971 and was recovered at a book sale in Carbondale, IL in 1971 by Mr. William H. Edwards. Mr. Edwards attempted to return the book immediately, but was instructed by the Librarian at Peabody College to keep it. He retained it until 2016, when he offered again. This time its value was recognized and it was accepted. We thank Mr. Edwards for his generosity and tenacity."
